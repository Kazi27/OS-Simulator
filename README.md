# OS-Simulator
## A Comprehensive Operating System Simulation

### This project implements a comprehensive operating system (OS) simulation designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for students and developers exploring the internal workings of an OS. It simulates essential functionalities, including:

- CPU Scheduling
  - Round-Robin scheduling ensures fair CPU allocation among processes.
- Memory Management
  - Paging with Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement efficiently utilizes memory resources.
- Disk Management
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) queues model disk I/O requests.

### Key Features:
- Realistic Scheduling and Management
  - The simulation closely reflects real-world OS behavior, enabling you to observe and analyze scheduling algorithms, memory allocation, and disk I/O operations.
- Customizable Parameters
  - Experiment with different configurations for CPU time slices, memory page sizes, and the number of disks to tailor the simulation to your specific exploration goals.
- Extensive API
  - The provided SimOS class offers a comprehensive set of methods for creating, managing, and interacting with processes, memory, disks, and CPU usage.
